FEATURES TODO
Generated: 2025-10-30

Completed features (and UI status):

- Auto Equip Weapon
  - Status: Completed
  - UI: Yes (UI.lua: "Auto Equip Weapon" checkbox -> OptionsAPI key: "AutoEquipWeapon")
  - Files: main.lua
  - Notes: main loop handles equipping based on OptionsAPI; RemoteAPI.CurrentWeapon is set by main.lua.

- Chest AutoFarm
  - Status: Completed
  - UI: Yes (UI.lua: "Chest Autofarm" checkbox -> OptionsAPI key: "ChestAutoFarm")
  - Files: Features/Auto Chest.lua, main.lua
  - Notes: Feature uses TeleportAPI (centralized). Confirm behavior in-game after recent changes.

- Autofarm (quest farming)
  - Status: Implemented (script exists)
  - UI: No
  - Files: Features/Autofarm.lua
  - Notes: Script uses DynamicAPI and TeleportAPI but is not wired into the main options/loop. Consider adding an OptionsAPI key and a UI checkbox.

- Fruit Sniper
  - Status: Implemented
  - UI: No
  - Files: Features/fruit sniper.lua
  - Notes: Uses direct Players access; consider switching to DynamicAPI and adding an OptionsAPI toggle + UI entry.

- Infinite Dash
  - Status: Implemented
  - UI: No
  - Files: Features/Infinite Dash.lua
  - Notes: Hooks CommE remote; switched to ServicesAPI for ReplicatedStorage. Consider adding an OptionsAPI toggle and UI checkbox.

- Saber Quest
  - Status: Partial / Needs integration
  - UI: No
  - Files: Features/saber quest.lua
  - Notes: Contains helper functions (pressPlates, grabTorch) but no top-level runner. Decide whether this should be auto-run or exposed as utility functions.

- Auto Kill (BETA)
  - Status: Implemented (in BETA folder)
  - UI: No
  - Files: BETA/auto-kill.lua
  - Notes: Duplicate attack/session logic exists here. BETA folder is experimental â€” do not modify without explicit request. Consider refactoring to use API/RemoteAPI.Attack if requested.

Unfinished / TODO features (suggested actions):

- Wire Autofarm into main loop
  - Add OptionsAPI key "AutoFarm" handling in main.lua and a checkbox in UI.lua.
  - Spawn the `Features/Autofarm.lua` runner when enabled.

- Add UI entries for remaining implemented features
  - Fruit Sniper, Infinite Dash, Autofarm, Saber Quest (if automated)
  - Each should set an OptionsAPI key and main.lua or a feature runner should respond to it.

- Centralize remotes into RemoteAPI (optional)
  - Several scripts call different remotes (CommF_, CommE, Net.*). Consider extending API/RemoteAPI or adding RemotesAPI to wrap/guard remote calls and make attack/quest remotes consistent.

- Replace remaining direct GetService usages with ServicesAPI
  - Search for any remaining `game:GetService` or direct `game.Players.LocalPlayer` usages and switch to ServicesAPI / DynamicAPI where appropriate.

Notes / Conventions
- "Completed" means a feature script exists and contains working logic; it may not be wired to the main Options/UI.
- BETA folder contains experimental scripts that must NOT be modified unless explicitly requested (see BETA/README_DO_NOT_TOUCH.txt).

Files to audit (quick checklist)
- main.lua
- UI.lua
- Features/Auto Chest.lua (done)
- Features/Autofarm.lua
- Features/fruit sniper.lua
- Features/Infinite Dash.lua
- Features/saber quest.lua
- BETA/auto-kill.lua (BETA)
- BETA/npc-api.luau (BETA)

If you want, I can:
- Add OptionsAPI/UI entries and wire Autofarm and the other features into main.lua.
- Replace remaining direct service/player accesses across the repo.
- Create a short PR-style patch for each suggested change for review.
